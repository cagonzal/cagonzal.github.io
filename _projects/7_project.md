Mean-flow-based linear analyses of turbulent flows, such as resolvent analysis, provide
valuable insight about flow structures and their dynamics that has been widely leveraged
to model, control, and understand the underlying flow physics. However, these analy-
ses are computationally expensive for flows over complex geometries and require the
use of specialized codes that are typically only available in research environments. On
the other hand, data-driven modal decompositions, such as the dynamic mode decom-
position (DMD), identify turbulent flow structures that, although statistically relevant,
do not provide insight into the physical mechanisms driving their dynamics.
