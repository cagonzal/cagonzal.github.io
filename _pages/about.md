I received my Ph.D in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford University in September 2025. As a graduate research assistant at the Center for Turbulence Research in Professor Parviz Moin's lab, my research was in the development of transition models to be used in wall-modeled large-eddy simulations. In particular, my work focused on the use of the parabolized stability equations as a physics-based approach to model modal transition processes. I have expertise in computational physics, numerical modeling, and high-performance computing.

In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing and video games. I've recently started playing guitar again after a 15-year hiatus. 

<!-- Apart from research, I'm an avid rock climber. Castle Rock state park is where I climb most, but I've been able to explore other crags in California and the west coast in general. Basketball, video games, and cooking are my other main hobbies. I'm also involved in a couple of outreach programs at Stanford.
