I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the department of Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University. My research is in the development of transition models to be used in wall-modeled large-eddy simulations. In particular, my work focuses on the use of the parabolized stability equations as a physics-based approach to model modal transition processes. My work is done in Professor Parviz Moin's group at the Center for Turbulence Research.

Apart from research, I'm an avid rock climber. Castle Rock state park is where I climb most, but I've been able to explore other crags in California and the west coast in general. Basketball, video games, and cooking are my other main hobbies. I'm also involved in a couple of outreach programs at Stanford.
