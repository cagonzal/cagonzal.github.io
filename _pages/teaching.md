#### <span style="color:var(--global-theme-color)"><b>Introduction to Numerical Methods for Engineering</b></span>
Teaching Assistant, Stanford University  
Spring 2021

Numerical methods from a userâ€™s point of view. Lagrange interpolation, splines. Integration: trapezoid, Romberg, Gauss, adaptive quadrature; numerical solution of ordinary differential equations: explicit and implicit methods, multistep methods, Runge-Kutta and predictor-corrector methods, boundary value problems, eigenvalue problems; systems of differential equations, stiffness. Emphasis is on analysis of numerical methods for accuracy, stability, and convergence. Introduction to numerical solutions of partial differential equations; Von Neumann stability analysis; alternating direction implicit methods and nonlinear equations.

#### <span style="color:var(--global-theme-color)"><b>Engineering Design Laboratory</b></span>
Teaching Assistant, California Institute of Technology  
Fall 2016 -  Winter 2017

A project-based course in which teams of students are challenged to design, test, analyze, and fabricate a robotic device to compete against devices designed by other student teams. The class lectures and team projects stress the integration of mechanical design, electronics, mechatronics, engineering analysis, and computation to solve problems in engineering system design. Critical feedback is provided through a series of formal design reviews scheduled throughout the ME 72 ab course sequence. 

#### <span style="color:var(--global-theme-color)"><b>Design and Fabrication</b></span>
Teaching Assistant, California Institute of Technology  
Spring 2016

Introduction to mechanical engineering design, fabrication, and visual communicaition. This class features a design project in which students use a limited budget to demonstrate mastery with the machine shop tools and design concepts taught in the class. 

#### <span style="color:var(--global-theme-color)"><b>Introduction to Machine Prototyping</b></span>
Teaching Assistant, California Institute of Technology  
Fall 2015 - Winter 2016

Students acquire the fundamental skills necessary to begin using 3D Computer-Aided Design Software. Students are introduced to manual machining techniques, as well as computer-controlled prototyping techniques, such as 3D printing, laser cutting, and water jet cutting.
